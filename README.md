### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Bri'ify Translator

A simple one-page website I built to practice using vanilla JavaScript and basic CSS. It uses regex to 'translate' plain English text into colloquial British English, or 'Bri'ish' (we don't say our 't's much). This was a fun project that allowed me to brush up on my front-end skills while creating something light-hearted and entertaining."
